    <h4>Japanese Anime Ranking </h4>
    <p>Anime TV series first found popularity outside of Japan in the 1980s and have continued to find larger audiences in the West. A number of famous anime shows originating in Japan - such as Cowboy Bebop or Dragon Ball Z - have found enthusiastic audiences for dubbed versions in English speaking countries. The anime style has grown so popular in the US, it has stared to significantly influence the style and aesthetics of American animation. Shows such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, Afro Samurai, and Samurai Jack have borrowed heavily from anime in terms of pacing, subject matter, and design.
        Ranking the greatest anime ever is certainly a difficult task, but it's time to settle this once and for all: which of the most popular anime shows crack the top 100., the top 10, or even the top 10 anime of all time?</p>
