        I completed both a full-stack Python and Data Science PT bootcamp with Coding Dojo. Can't say enough great
        things about the school, it's online curriculum platform and relevance to current industry standards. I was
        fortunate to have both Michael and Noelle as my main instructors through both platforms, and cannot say enough
        about their patient teaching methods.
